CISCO Packet Tracer DNS DHCP HTTP Servers with two different IP pools with Abrar.it web server


This is a beginner level project for learning and implementation. CISCO Packet tracer allows us to simulate networks. I have designed this network for the small enterprizes.

- This network is very simple but is able to handle a larege ammount of hosts
- There is a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) used to handle a large number of cients
- DNS and Http help here to provide web services and hassel free browsing 
- Two different IP Pools are used here for the Hosts
